# Quiz-Manager
This program will allow you to take or create quizzes once you have logged in successfully. You can also add new users or quizmasters.\

## Read me:
This program combines SQL and Python, it will automatically create a new database if one does not exist. You just have to change the connection user and password so that it matches your SQL credentialds.

All the data will be saved in the appropriate database tables.

There is a login proccess as well as the ability to add new quiz takers and quiz masters.

I completed this project in partnership with Jarryd Robson.
